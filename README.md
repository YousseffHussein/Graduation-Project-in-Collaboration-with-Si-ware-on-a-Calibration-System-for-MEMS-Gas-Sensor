# üî¨ MEMS Gas Meter Calibration System

This repository documents the design and development of a **Calibration System for MEMS Gas Meters**, created as part of the Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering at Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology (E-JUST). The project was completed in collaboration with NeoSpectra Si-Ware.

## üìÑ Project Description

The project focuses on improving the reliability and precision of **MEMS-based infrared (IR) gas sensors**, which are widely used for detecting various gases in environmental monitoring, industrial processes, and mobile robotics applications.

### Key Challenges Addressed

- **Thermal Management:** MEMS gas sensors are sensitive to heat fluctuations, which impact measurement accuracy. A thermal control system was developed using:
  - Thermoelectric coolers (TECs)
  - Heat pipes and heat sinks
  - Aluminum blocks as thermal interface materials (TIMs)
  - Thermal vias for enhanced heat transfer

- **Vibration Suppression:** Vibrations from drone or robot motion introduce noise and instability. Vibration damping solutions include:
  - PDMS and silicone rubber dampers
  - Specialized mechanical structures
  - Experimental testing for damping efficiency

- **Mechanical Design and Certification:** A robust sensor enclosure was designed:
  - Fiberglass mechanical housing
  - Gas chamber and cover designs
  - Components tested for overpressure, drop tests, and vibration resistance
  - Compliance with industry certifications (e.g., ATEX, IP67)

### Technological Highlights

- **Infrared Spectroscopy:** Used for gas detection by measuring specific IR absorption bands linked to gas molecular vibrations.
- **Thermal Circuit Simulation:** Thermal behavior modeled using LTspice simulations.
- **Material Selection:** Careful selection of materials such as PDMS, aluminum, and fiberglass for optimal mechanical and thermal properties.
